# Enhanced-DARPA-SCORE-claims-dataset
Goal: To enhance Darpa Claims dataset(i.i. a new column) that makes use of web mining techniques

#About the dataset:
The DARPA SCORE Dataset contains claims from about 3,000 empirical papers published between 2009 and 2018 in approximately 60 journals in the social and behavioral sciences

#Why do we want to enhance:
There is substantial interest in the extent to which published findings in social-behavioral sciences are reproducible and whether it is possible to predict the likelihood of reproducing. 
Large-scale replication and prediction market projects in some subfields — particularly parts of psychology and economics — have provided initial evidence that reproducibility may be lower than expected or desired, 
and that surveys of experts and prediction markets may be effective at predicting reproducible findings.
DARPA identifies the purpose of SCORE is “to develop and deploy automated tools to assign ‘confidence scores’ to different SBS research results and claims. 

#Added new feature:
1. Eigen Value - values scraped from eigenfactor.org for unique journal names
2. H-index and total citations
